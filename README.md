### JavaScript Rock,Paper,Scissiors Game

This is my one first my first project in JavaScript. The familiar game of Rock, Paper, Scissors is played like this: at the same time, 
two players display one of three symbols: a rock, paper, or scissors. A rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper by cutting it, and paper
beats rock by covering it.

### Lessons Learned

This game project really helped me with the conditional statement and also makes me understand loop more. 
The UI process was also cool, I was also able to work more with the DOM and playing with around with it gives me more understanding on 
the subject.

### How to play.
This game is easy to play if you understand the rules (which i have talked about above), click one of the button and it will display the winner 
of that particular round, you can play it 5 times, (you can restart again) the winner after every 5 rounds will be show.
