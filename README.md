JavaScript Rock,Paper,Scissiors Game
This is my one first my first project in JavaScript. The familiar game of Rock, Paper, Scissors is played like this: at the same time, 
two players display one of three symbols: a rock, paper, or scissors. A rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper by cutting it, and paper
beats rock by covering it.

Lessons Learned
This game project really helped me with the conditional statement and also makes me understand loop more.
